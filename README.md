# Embedded-Rust-Learning-Resources

Embedded Rust is a new phenomenon at the time of this writing.  Fortunately, for those who want to learn how to do it, 
ample resources are available.

This page will serve as a basic aggregation point for learning how to do embedded programming with Rust.

I currently have a NUCLEO-f030R8 board.  I will be getting a bbc micro:bit v2 soon.
